Step 1 Prepare the potato-peas mixture and make tikkis with it
To make this easy Aloo Tikki recipe, take a glass bowl and add potatoes, peas, coriander leaves, chaat masala, chilli powder, cornflour, salt in it. Mix well all these ingredients. Once done, divide the mixture into 12 equal portions and shape each portion into a round tikki.
Step 2 Coat the tikkis with breadcrumb and shallow fry them
Now, to attain a crispy texture, coat the prepared tikkis with breadcrumbs on all sides by rolling it in the breadcrumbs filled plate. Meanwhile, heat oil in a pan over medium flame and shallow fry the tikkis, till both sides are golden brown in colour.
Step 3 Serve Aloo Tikkis hot
Once done, transfer the Aloo Tikkis on a kitchen towel so that excess oil is absorbed. Place the homemade Aloo Tikkis on a serving plate and pair it with tomato ketchup or green chutney. These tikkis taste the best when served with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee.
